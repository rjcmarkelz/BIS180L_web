## Assignment 6: Gene Networks

This should be a knittable .Rmd file.  Include this file and a .html when you turn in the assignment.

**EXERCISE 1:** Extending the example that I gave for BOS/NY/DC, what are the distances that define each split in the West Coast side of the hclust plot? X 
*Hint 1: Start with the distances between SF and LA. Then look at the difference between that cluster up to SEA*  X
*Hint 2: Print cities, you only need to look at the upper right triangle of data matrix.*

What is the city pair and distance the joins the East Coast and West Coast cities? Fill in the values.  X
*Hint: Think Midwest.*



**EXERCISE 2:** What is the general pattern in the h-clustering data? Using what you learned from the city example, what is the subcluster that looks very different than the rest of the samples?  X
*Hint: It is a group of 3 libraries. You will have to plot this yourself and stretch it out. The rendering on the website compresses the output.*



**EXERCISE 3:** With k = 4 as one of the arguments to the `rect.hclust()` function, what is the largest and smallest group contained within the rectangles? Use characteristics in the sample name to describe the clusters.  X
Play with the k-values. Find a new k-value between 3 and 7 and describe how the samples are falling out. 



**EXERCISE 4:** After running the 50 bootstrap samples, leave the plot open. Then change `nboot` to 500. In general, what happens to AU comparing the two plots by flipping between them?



**Exercise 5:** 
We used the scale rows option. This is necessary so that every *row* in the dataset will be on the same scale when visualized in the heatmap. This is to prevent really large values somewhere in the dataset dominating the heatmap signal. Remember if you still have this dataset in memory you can take a look at a printed version to the terminal. Compare the distance matrix that you printed with the colors of the heat map. See the advantage of working with small test sets? Take a look at your plot of the cities heatmap and interpret what a dark red value and a light yellow value in the heatmap would mean in geographic distance. Provide an example of of each in your explanation.



**Exercise 6:** 
The genes are definitely overplotted and we cannot tell one from another. However, what is the most obvious pattern that you can pick out from this data? Describe what you see. Make sure you plot this in your own session so you can stretch it out.
*Hint It will be a similar pattern as you noticed in the h-clustering example.*



**Exercise 7:** In the similar way that you interpreted the color values of the heatmap for the city example, come up with a biological interpretation of the yellow vs. red color values in the heatmap. What would this mean for the pattern that you described in exercise 6? Discuss.



**Exercise 8:** Pretty Colors! Describe what you see visually with 2, 5, 9, and 15 clusters using either method. Why would it be a bad idea to have to few or to many clusters? Discuss with a specific example comparing few vs. many k-means. Justify your choice of too many and too few clusters by describing what you see in each case.



**Exercise 9:** Based on this Gap statistic plot at what number of k clusters (x-axis) do you start to see diminishing returns? To put this another way, at what value of k does k-1 and k+1 start to look the same for the first time? Or yet another way, when are you getting diminishing returns for adding more k-means? See if you can make the tradeoff of trying to capture a lot of variation in the data as the Gap statistic increases, but you do not want to add too many k-means because your returns diminish as you add more. Explain your answer using the plot as a guide to help you interpret the data.



**Exercise 10:** What did clusGap() calculate? How does this compare to your answer from Exercise 9? Make a plot using the combined autoplot() and kmeans functions as you did before, but choose the number of k-means you chose and the number of k-means that are calculated from the Gap Statistic. Describe the differences in the plots.
