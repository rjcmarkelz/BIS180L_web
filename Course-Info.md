## Written Assignments
There will be written assignments due every week or two. Assignments will generally be __due at 9:00AM on Monday__ for the previous week’s material. Weekly assignments will take one of two forms:

1. __Problem sets.__ Problem sets will consist of questions that you answer as you work through the lab material. They may consist of combinations of short answers, code segments, figures, and other data analysis. You should be able to complete these during the scheduled lab periods.
2. __Lab reports.__ For lab reports you will write a short document describing your analysis. Lab reports are should consist of two to three pages of text (minimum font size: 12 points, minimum page margins 1”) and have up to four figures or tables (which do not count towards the page limit). Please see separate document on SmartSite for more information

## About This Class
Recent technological advances in the field of genomics over the last dozen years have revolutionized many aspects of biological research. To be a successful biologist today it is often critical to have the skills required to analyze large genomics data sets. Most analyses of this type are done using command-line tools in the Linux/Unix environment, using scripting languages like Python or Perl, and in the statistical programming language R. While it is not possible for us to cover all of these areas in depth in a single quarter, we will give you hands-on experience with a variety of analysis methods and tools that will serve as a foundation on which you can build.

## On Plagiarism
You will often work with a lab partner as you do the lab exercises. However you must each write your own answers for worksheets and lab reports. In addition, while the web is a powerful resource for information it is plagiarism and a SJA violation to cut and paste information directly from web sources without indicating that you are quoting and providing a citation.
