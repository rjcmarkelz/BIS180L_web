title: Discussions and Discussion Leaders
---

In lieu of formal student presentations I have decided that the most helpful thing is to have weekly __discussion leaders__.  The idea is to discuss aspects of the lab assignment that were interesting, confusing, or hard.  The discussion leaders will facilitate the discussion but the class should participate in the discussion.  The discussion will take place before the due date so that you can updated your assignments with insights gained from the discussion.

We had a sign-up for this on Friday.  __If you were not there send me an email__.

This will be a significant component of the "presentation/participation" part of your grade.

## Expectations

* Each discussion leader should pick one question for discussion with the class.
* The question should relate to the assigned topic and the previous lab exercises.
* The question can be from the assignment itself or something else that came up.
* It can relate either to programming (how did you solve X?) or to interpretation.
* The discussion leader should think through the various possible answers to the question.
* Discussion leaders need to coordinate their questions in advance so that there is not repetition of topics.
